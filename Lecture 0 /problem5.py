""" 
Now say you can no longer buy fractions of a gallon. 
(For instance, if you need 4.3 gallons to do a project, then you have to buy 5 gallons of paint.)

With this new scenario, you will create a new function get_actual_cost that uses 
the same inputs and calculates the cost of your project.

One function that you'll need to use to do this is math.ceil(). 
We demonstrate usage of this function in the code cell below. 
It takes as a number as input and rounds the number up to the nearest integer.

Run the next code cell to test this function for yourself. 
Feel free to change the value of test_value and make sure math.ceil() returns the number you expect.
