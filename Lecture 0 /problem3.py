""" 
You're a home decorator, and you'd like to use Python to streamline some of your work. 
Specifically, you're creating a tool that you intend to use to calculate the cost of painting a room.

As a first step, define a function get_cost() that takes as input:

sqft_walls = total square feet of walls to be painted
sqft_ceiling = square feet of ceiling to be painted
sqft_per_gallon = number of square feet that you can cover with one gallon of paint
cost_per_gallon = cost (in dollars) of one gallon of paint
It should return the cost (in dollars) of putting one coat of paint on all walls and the ceiling. 
Assume you can buy the exact amount of paint that you need, so you can buy partial gallons 
(e.g., if you need 7.523 gallons, you can buy that exact amount, instead of needing 
to buy 8 gallons and waste some paint). Do not round your answer.
