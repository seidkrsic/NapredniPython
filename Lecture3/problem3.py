""" 
Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called 
first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes 
that are typically stored in a user profile. 
Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s 
information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a 
personalized greeting to the user.
Create several instances representing different users, 
and call both meth- ods for each user.
